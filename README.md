# What is Seating Planner?
Did you and your class, you and your wedding or you and whatever you can think of needed to seat many people on tables? Of you course you wanted to respect every individual but it's just so damn complicated to do that - especially if you have other things to do!  
That's why I made Seating Planner. You can create a plan of tables and tell it who wants to sit next and definitely not next to whom. You can even specify multiple of those wishes.

# How far is the project?
Seating Planner still needs plenty of time! I finished the algorithm quite some time ago however I wasted a ton of time trying to building the program with react and kotlin but I got fed up of it pretty fast. I also don't have the time I'd like to have, I still attend school. I can't say when - hell even if - I will finish Seating Planner but I hope it's done before 2019; I don't think I work efficient, I spend a lot of time googling things, trying to figure out design-parts or just re-doning a bunch of work just because it doesn't fit the rest of the project.

# What are you going to do with Seating Planner?
It is quite likely that I will publish my app in the Appstore though it is highly dependent on how the product turns out to be - in the way it was designed and looks as well as in how usefull it turns out to be. If it's a success (by literally any means, if don't really have expectations regarding it's downloads, etc.), I will perhaps even port it to a native app and/or website.

# Is it going to be free?
I don't know yet.
